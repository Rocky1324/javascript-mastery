## 📈 Learning Progress

### ✅ Completed
- [x] **Variables & Data Types** – let, const, var
- [x] **Functions** – Regular functions, arrow functions, scope
- [x] **DOM Manipulation** – `getElementById`, `innerHTML`, event listeners
- [x] **Event Handling** – Click events, form interactions
- [x] **Control Flow** – if/else, loops, conditionals
- [x] **Game Logic** – State management, user interaction

### 🔄 Currently Working On
- [ ] **Form Validation** – Input checking, error messages

## 📚 Study Notes & Resources

### Key Concepts Mastered
```javascript
// Event Handling
document.getElementById("submit").onclick = function() {
    // Handle user interaction
};

// DOM Manipulation
document.getElementById("message").innerHTML = "Dynamic content";

// Dynamic Element Creation
const btn = document.createElement("button");
btn.textContent = "Replay";
document.getElementById("main").appendChild(btn);
```
